# Social Media App

This project was developed by Spivac Iana.

## Purpose

This application allows to create a profile and also to write posts,delete them or "like" them.

## Tech stack

This application uses React framework.
In order to create and maintain the current user, there was used Redux library for state management of authentification and errors which could appear during sign in/sign up. Also
this applicaion useses Firebase features as Realtime Database and Storage in order to save users data.

## Limitations and Warnings

Being a serveless app, it has limited backend manipulations. It is not a complete product and it should be viewed only as a sketch, it is a vulnerable app and the user should not expose personal data, having a violent behaviour and should avoid spamming posts.
!Had some problem with deploy on github pages and currently on refresh it gives error, in this case just rewrite in the link bar:https://ianaspivac.github.io/social-media/

## Test

Anyone can try this app, currently application does not require the email validation, so any dummy email can be used.
